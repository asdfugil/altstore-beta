will get an actual domain as soon as possible. Please add 
nickchan.gq to your adblocker excpetions if you encounter

or track you (other than what GitHub does on all GitHub pages 
- I cannot control that). When the domain changes, the new URL 
will always be available at

If your version of AltStore only allow 'trusted' sources, open 
this URL in Safari: 
`altstore://source?url=https://nickchan.gq/altstore-beta/apps-safe.json`
